  Making a one-time donation offers a direct and bespoke way to support us by sponsoring one of our shows. With a one-off donation, you can help us meet one or more of the various goals for putting on a production. If you have a specific show or performance that you want to support, a one-time donation will literally help to make it happen and get you involved in the actual production

  #### What can my donation cover?

  There are a number of different aspects of the performance you can consider

  - Sponsor the programme - **£100**

  - Sponsor a role for one performance - **£200**

  - Sponsor a role for the whole run - **£500**

  - Sponsor our costumes - **£500** 

  - Sponsor the whole show - **£1,500**


  These are guidelines about what we can do with the amounts specified, but of course the amount that you donate is up to you

  #### What are the benefits? 

  - All sponsors are acknowledged by name in the programme of the show that they sponsor

  - Receive a signed copy of the programme

  - Get a chance to meet the cast member you are sponsoring and have a photo with them in costume as a souvenir
