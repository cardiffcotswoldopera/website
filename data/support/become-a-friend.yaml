  If you're looking to support us in a more sustained way, consider becoming a Friend of Cardiff Cotswold Opera. By setting up a recurring monthly or annual donation, you can help us keep going day by day, help us fund things like publicity and printing costs, and help us grow while keeping the costs of seeing our shows affordable for everybody

  Benefits

  - Acknowledgement of your support on the website

  - An invitation to the official Friends of Cardiff Cotswold Reception on the first or second night of each performance, where you can enjoy a glass of bubbles and meet the cast and production team before the show

  - Automatic subscription to our regular email newsletter

  - Reserved prime seating for all operas and concerts, even when tickets are sold unreserved

  > Our donation pages (with the capacity to automatically set up recurring payments) are still under construction. The link above will allow you to set up a one-off payment, but if you would like to set up a recurring payment you can [download and fill out the donation form as a PDF](/static/uploads/Become+a+Friend+of+Cardiff+Cotswold+Opera.pdf)
