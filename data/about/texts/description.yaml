  Cardiff Cotswold Opera is a charity dedicated to improving access to high quality opera performances for new and less traditional audiences. We operate across South Wales and the South West of England, providing opportunities to emerging talent from the area as well as bringing exceptional talent from further afield to perform for audiences here
  
  ## Bringing magic, mayhem, and mirth to an evening near you

  As a performer-led charity dedicated to opening the world of opera to new and less traditional audiences, our main goals are: 

  - Providing accessible, engaging, and enjoyable shows to new audiences in South Wales and the South West of England
  
  - Providing opportunities to showcase emerging talent from South Wales and the South West of England, including performers, musicians, and composers 
  
  - Bringing exceptional talent to perform in South Wales and the South West of England, providing local access to the highest quality opera 

 
  Our mission is to engage our local communities in the wonderful world of opera through a variety of different means:

  - Tried-and-true classic operas, such as La bohème, The Barber of Seville, and Così fan tutte, performed with fresh takes in local venues that allow for rich and intimate audience experiences that appeal to first-time opera-goers as well as life-long fans
  
  - Exciting modern operas that present fresh perspectives on well known stories, such as Mansfield Park and Much Ado About Nothing, bringing something new and exciting to even the most avid Glyndebourne patron
  
  -  Themed evenings and events where operatic favourites are showcased in fun and creative ways, such as murder and mayhem in our audience-favourite Murder at the Opera evening
