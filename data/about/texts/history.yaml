  Originally founded under the name Cardiff Opera by William Stevens and Thomas Mottershead whilst they were both studying singing and conducting, respectively, at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. Starting with no funding or administrative support, they produced a successful debut production of Handel's 'Giulio Cesare in Egitto' at The Cornerstone in Cardiff, and a further ten shows between 2021 and 2024.
  
  In 2023 Megan Strachan came aboard as a new co-creative director for the company and we began to reimagine our future as an expanding company and rebranded as Cardiff Cotswold Opera. We also began specialising in a unique intimate way of staging operas to allow the audience to feel completely immersed in the story. Despite limited resources we have always been an ambitious company determined to bring high quality operas and concerts to new audiences. We are lucky to have cultivated an incredible team of creatives working towards accessible operatic excellence within each of our projects.
