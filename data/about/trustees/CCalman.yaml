    Chris likes to think he represents 'the consumer' or, at least, the older consumer, having been enjoying Opera and Operetta now for over seventy years. After forty years in London general practice and medical education, he, and his wife Angela, have retired quietly to the country, only to discover the truth of the old adage  'how did we ever have time to go to work?!' They are very excited to be able to be involved in the development of Cardiff Cotswold Opera. "
