    As an opera singer herself Megan decided one day that she just had too much free time on her hands and decided to become a trustee and creative director of an opera company! The whole experience has been a complete rollercoaster and allowed Megan to see all the nuts and bolts that go into creating these gorgeous productions that bring joy to so many. Megan first ventured into this side of things in 2023 when she produced our first production of la Boheme in which she also sang Mimi… and found the singing to be by far the easiest bit. She is looking forward to the future challenges this company will bring.
