  Prepare yourself for an evening where glamour, glorious music, and scandal collide. With not just one but two chances to solve the mystery!
  Cardiff Cotswold Opera invites you to a dazzling opera gala—sparkling arias, show-stopping musical theatre favourites, and a room 
  full of larger-than-life personalities. But just as the night reaches its high note… disaster strikes. The diva is dead.

  Act One erupts into chaos as accusations fly, egos clash, and musical rivalries are laid bare. With the audience drawn into the intrigue, our colourful
  suspects await the arrival of a detective determined to uncover the truth.

  In Act Two, the gloves come off. Through witty musical interrogations and unexpected revelations, the mystery deepens and the laughter builds—all racing toward a surprising and delightfully
  twisted conclusion. Known for performances that make you laugh, cry, and lean forward in your seat, Cardiff Cotswold Opera delivers an unforgettable night of music, mischief, and mayhem.
  
  Expect drama. Expect comedy. Expect the unexpected.
